Since 2019 I started a new hobby and dove into the world of viniculture and winemaking. One thing I have quickly learned is that it is important to keep a log of all actions you do throughout the season and the wine making process. Winery was created to support grape growers and wine makers to support them in any step of the process.

In first place, it allows users to keep track of the different actions during the grape growing season. When the grapes have been harvestes, the application allows you to create and follow up different vintages from harvest to bottling.

The latest version of the application is currently hosted at [https://myvineyards.org/](https://myvineyards.org/)
